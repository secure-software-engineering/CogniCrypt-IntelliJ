# CogniCrypt for Android Studio

This repository contains an Android Studio Plugin for CogniCrypt.

**Launch Requirements**:
- Android Studio (tested with version 2018.3.6)

---

# Build 

##### Build Requirements
- IntelliJ  2019.1.3
- Java Development Kit 8 (either Oracle or OpenJDK will do)

Using JDK 8 currently is a hard requirement. Any version lower or higher will cause a build error. There are two places to make sure the project is built with a specific JDK version:

1. Open the module settings for ***icognicrypt*** (F4) and check if the Project SDK under `Project Settings -> Project` refers to a JDK 8 version.
2. Gradle settings:
    a) Gradle utilized in the IDE's terminal gets its JDK reference through the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable of the operating system. Change the value of that variable if required and reboot the system for the changes to take effect. You can check the used JDK/JVM by typing `gradlew -v`.
    b) When using the IDE's built-in run and debug commands (the buttons in the top toolbar), Gradle uses a JDK version that is specified in the settings of IntelliJ. Open the settings and go to `Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle`. Edit the `Gradle JVM` setting as required (suggestion: choose the option: *Use Project JDK*).

Run `gradlew assemble`  or `gradlew build` in root directory.

# Debug

To enable the debug functionality you need to add a run configuration in IntelliJ.
1. Click `Add Configuration` in the top toolbar.
2. Press the `+` symbol and add a Gradle build.
3. As Gradle Project choose ***icognicrypt*** from the drop down menu.
4. Enter `:runIde` as Task and optionally `--info` as Argument.
5. Press **Apply** and **OK**
